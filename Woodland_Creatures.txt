2X INTRO

Imagine a scene with all the woodland creatures and they're
Running around in the sun and the grass full of flowers
Imagine a scene with university students and they're they're
Dancing with now only bedsheets draped round their bodies
Imagine a scene in which you look at me and
You're wondering why there's a twinkling gleam in the water

CHORUS
And if you see them, you gotta open your eyes and
If you catch them, you gotta take 'em alive and
If you want to, you gotta love your surprise because the winner
Is the one who's satisfied

2X INTRO

Imagine a scene in the protected green where the
Woodland creatures are safe at last from the wild
Imagine a scene with iron, coal, and steam where the
Humans have taken the life and dreams from the tide
Imagine a scene involving you and me in which we
Know that the answer is not what it seems in the fire

REPEAT CHORUS

4X SOLO
